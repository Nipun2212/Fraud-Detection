## **Fraud Detection using Python**


A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this project, we will try to fight fraud by using data by applying supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud. 

Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to the norm.  As such, we need to properly classify imbalanced datasets.

The project demonstrates how to implement fraud detection model and prevent common mistakes in fraud analytics.
